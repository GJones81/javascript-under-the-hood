//This is called a function constructor.
//We've used a function to construct an object.

//new is an operator
//When we say new, an empty object is created (like var a = {}).
//Then it invokes the function.
//The execution context generates 'this'.
//When you use new, it changes where the 'this' variable points.
//It now points to the new empty object.
//As long as the function doesn't return anything, the Javascript engine
//will return the object created by the new operator.

var jane = new Person('Jane', 'Doe')
console.log(jane)
//Logs PersonÂ {firstname: "Jane", lastname: "Doe"}
//Function constructors are just functions. The new operator doesn't change this.
//Putting the new operator in front of a function sets
//the 'this' keyword to a brand new empty object.
//And if the function doesn't return anything, it will return the object. Instead of undefined.

//Forgetting to use the 'new' keyword can cause problems.
var joe = Person('Joe', 'Schmoe')
//The Person() function is meant to be a function constructor, so it doesn't return anything
//But function constructors are still functions and we can call them by accident like this.
//Since Person() doesn't have a return statement, this function returns undefined.
console.log(joe)
//Logs undefined since Person doesn't have a 'new' operator in front of it,
//thus is calling the function that doesn't have a return statement and returns undefined.
console.log(joe.firstname)
//Logs an error since joe is set to undefined.

//Always make sure your function constructors start with a capital letter so you can catch these errors beforehand
